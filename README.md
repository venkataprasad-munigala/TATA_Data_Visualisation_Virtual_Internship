## Task 1 - Framing the Business Scenario
Learn how to anticipate the questions your business leaders will need answers to.

####  Background info and context

An online retail store has hired you as a consultant for analyzing data to provide insights for the CEO and CMO. They want to understand revenue factors for strategic planning. The focus is on operations and marketing metrics, as well as identifying high-performing areas. Demographic metrics are of interest too. You must prepare analytics and insights for an upcoming CEO and CMO meeting to evaluate performance and expansion decisions. Adopting a business leader's perspective is key to effective analysis and insights.

#### Details for task

Draft essential questions for the CEO and CMO based on the dataset, considering both quantitative and qualitative aspects.
Create a set of four questions that you anticipate each business leader will ask and want to know the answers to. Make sure you differentiate your questions, as both the CEO and CMO view business decisions through different lenses.

## Task 2 - Choosing the Right Visuals
Learn which visuals are most effective in a given scenario

#### Background info and context

For the CEO and CMO, create visuals to analyze online retail store metrics. Gather requirements and select the best-suited visuals. Senior management seeks performance insights, key strengths, and growth opportunities. Ensure clear and accurate data representation to avoid misinterpretation or wrong decisions.

#### Details for task

Select visuals for CEO and CMO requirements. Choose the most suitable chart type to represent each scenario. Remember, data can be presented in multiple types of charts, but you are required to select the visual that would best display the information that is being presented. Utilize provided resources for guidance on visual selection and chart options. Complete a 5-question multiple-choice quiz.

## Task 3 - Creating Effective Visuals
Apply your under and create visuals based on business scenarios

#### Background info and context

The CEO and CMO seek data analysis and visuals for decision-making and expansion planning. They want insights into revenue trends and category breakdowns. After gathering requirements, ensure data quality, and create visuals in either Tableau or Power BI for effective decision support in the expansion strategy.

#### Details for task

In this task, you will create the visuals around four of the questions that the CEO and CMO have requested. You can use either Tableau or Power BI to create the visuals.

#### Data cleanup

You have noticed that the data contains some returns to the store which are provided in negative quantities and there are unit prices that were input in error. 
Clean the data before analysis:

• Ensure quantity is not below 1 unit

• Verify the unit price is not below $0

Use conditional formulas or data transformation methods to exclude bad data. Organize visuals on separate tabs, naming each after the question number. Save files in .twbx format for Tableau and .pbix format for Power BI. Clean data before addressing any questions.

#### Question 1

The CEO of the retail store is interested in viewing the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.

#### Question 2

The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.

#### Question 3

The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue-generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue-generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue-generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.

#### Question 4

The CEO is looking to gain insights into the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities.

## Task 4 - Communicating Insights and Analysis
Effectively communicate your findings and explain how it relates to each scenario

#### Background info and context

Present findings to CEO and CMO. Explain the data cleanup and visualization process clearly. Discuss the analysis of all four previous questions. Expansion is top of mind for these leaders, so focus on identifying lucrative expansion opportunities.

#### Details for task

Create a concise 5-minute video presentation for the CEO and CMO, based on the four questions and visuals from the previous tasks. Explain the entire process, including data loading and cleanup, to demonstrate diligence. Focus on the key information relevant to the leaders and provide context for each scenario in relation to their questions.
